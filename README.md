# Yet Another Event Dispatcher

This is a C clone PHP Extension of [Symfony Event Dispatcher Framework](https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher)

The main purpose of this project is reinventing whells for practice

And it's still under development and not ready for any environment

Salute to [Laruence](http://github.com/laruence) and his great work [YetAnotherFramework](https://github.com/laruence/php-yaf)
